Hello and Welcome !

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
        printf("hello, world\n");
}
{% endhighlight %}

For a long time, I had the idea of setting up my own website/blog, I've done some shy attempts before but this one is the one! So welcome to my blog, and to this unavoidable "Hello, world!" post! :D

I've built this blog with [Jekyll](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) using the [Indigo theme](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo), the code source is available at [Github](https://github.com/Aallam/aallam.github.io).

Cheers,<br/>
